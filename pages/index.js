        I have been ardent practitioner of cloud computing for over 4 years and have experience across multiple platforms. On the other hand , I am active UI/UX designer, having worked with multiple startups to revamp their products into a more appealing look. As far as full stack goes, I have had my fair share of work in majority of the stacks like MERN,MEAN etc.
